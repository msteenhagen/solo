*This workshop was organised by Jennifer Hornsby, at Birkbeck College London,  around a focus article by Christos Douskos on the distinction between habits and skills. My contribution was a short paper on what can be called the* historicity *of habit.*  

**Abstract:** In order to develop two points about the ‘historicity’ of habit, I consider two questions, answers to which could shed further light on the nature of habits and their difference from skills. The first is, *Can a habit itself have a history?* I argue that all habits indeed have histories, and will suggest that this allows a habit to change. I will then ask, second, *To what extent can habits change?* I think that habits can change considerably, and will give some reason to think that they may perhaps change beyond recognition. With this I mean that a habit to φ can change into a habit to ψ, where 'φ-ing' and 'ψ-ing' are action-specifications that differ considerably. This, I suggest, sheds further light on the historicity of habits.
