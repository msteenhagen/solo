**Abstract:**
Our imagination can play tricks on us. Can we exploit this truism to cover cases of severe pathology? In this paper I argue that the experience of thought insertion––a symptom typical of schizophrenia, but perhaps not limited to it––could be so covered. I will first bring out how our ordinary psychology seems well-equipped to handle thoughts that aren't thought by the subject who is aware of them. I will then show how we equally seem quite familiar with cases where thoughts we become aware of and that aren't thought by us, are thought by someone else. If I am right, subjects could indeed come to have before their minds thoughts that are thought by someone else.
