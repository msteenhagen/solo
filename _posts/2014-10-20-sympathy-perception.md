*On the 20th of Ocotober 2014, I presented some work in progress on the psychological capacity of sympathy---the capacity to 'feel along' with other people. The paper was written for the October meeting of the International Network for Sympathy, Empathy and Imagination (INSEI). Because I couldn't be in Oxford myself, I recorded it as a video.*


**Abstract:** 
Sympathy is often understood as the capacity to 'tap into someone else's feelings', to 'feel with them', or to 'feel what they feel'. In this paper I want to approach a serious philosophical issue about this capacity through the lens of a fundamental dispute in the philosophy of perception. The serious philosophical issue about sympathy I am interested in is that of understanding the basic elements and relations involved in an act of sympathising. And the fundamental dispute in the philosophy of perception I'll talk about is precisely about such basic elements and relations, but then how they are involved in our perceptual awareness of our surroundings. Comparing sympathy with perception brings out how it is all too easy to overlook viable options. In particular, I want to flag that a na√Øve, 'direct' account of sympathy that allows us to feel the actual feelings of others, is frequently not even considered an available view.
