title: Non-conceptualised depiction
description: "It is a commonplace that what we can see in a picture comprises its representational content. A ‘concept principle’ seems to govern how we come to see these contents. Viewers can only ever see the things the picture depicts if they possess a concept of whatever it is that is depicted. Pictorial content is not presented to us in a non-conceptualised way."

Can we see a torquetum in Holbein’s _The Ambassadors_? If you have no idea what a torquetum is, then there just seems no good reason to think that you see it. Consider, there is no actual torquetum presented to you. And, we should realise, Holbein’s paint is unable to determine or fix the kinds of objects it represents.

It is a commonplace that what we can see in a picture comprises its representational content. A 'concept principle' seems to govern how we come to see these contents. Viewers can only ever see the things the picture depicts if they possess a concept of whatever it is that is depicted. Pictorial content is not presented to us in a non-conceptualised way.
