*I've presented this material at the 88th Joint Session of the Aristotelian Society and the Mind Association, held at Fitzwilliam College, University of Cambridge.*

**Abstract:** 
Source representationalism is the view that the sources of the sounds we hear, whenever they are heard, are represented in experience. Source representationalists may accept that auditory experience consists in a perceptual relation to particular sounds. What they deny is that hearing a sound source consists in a perceptual relation to such a source. Starting from arguments about listening to recordings, I develop a defence of the source representationalistâ€™s thesis. I show that listening to recordings enables us to hear sound sources representationally. I then demonstrate that, given the structure and character of auditory perception, hearing a source when it is actually producing the sounds one hears is equally representational. This establishes source representationalism as a global thesis about auditory perception. This conclusion has important implications for our understanding of perceptual representation more generally.
