*The organisers of the Annual Conference of the American Society of Aesthetics invited me to respond to a paper by Summer Renault-Steele, who is at Villanova University.* 

In her paper, 'Girls Unnatural and Ornaments Unmasked', Renault-Steele defends Siegfried Kracauer against the charge that the perspective he adopts in his essay ‘The Mass Ornament’ is an instance of a harmful, objectifying way of perceiving or portraying people. In my response I highlighted some more general issues about psychoanalytic interpretation and about the philosophical method Kracauer puts to practice.
